# RASPBERRY-ZERO-INTERNET-RADIO
 
This is not the first raspberry internet radio, i know. But this one is:

- very cheap and works really good
- all functions controllable via a webinterface, your phone is the remote control
- very easy to build and operate
- portable due to the easy connection to wifi
- has a very nice MP3 player
- it has a 10 channel equalizer
- No programming or soldering skills needed. 

<br>
Just buy the components, connect some wires between them and thats it!. Oh, and burn an image of the radio operating system on an sd card.

It would be a nice birthday present as it is very easy to operate. This radio has a lot of nice features. All controllable via a webinterface. There is a.o. a 10 channel equalizer, a timer and mp3player. You can easely compile 2 lists of favorite stations. Artists / Songtitles are shown on the LCD and the webpage.
